This is the Official TYPO3 Introduction Package
===============================================

This carefully crafted extension gives you a small insight in the powerful
toolbox of the TYPO3 CMS framework.

It comes with a full-fledged website, delivering a theme based on Twitter
bootstrap with simple options to modify the base theme.

Installation
------------

a) Install `introduction` distribution using the extension manager in the
backend of your TYPO3 installation. Find the distribution in "Get preconfigured distribution".

b) Alternatively, add `introduction` via composer `composer require typo3/cms-introduction`
to your existing composer based project, go the backend extension manager and
load the extension.
Since TYPO3 11.5 it is essential to setup the extension afterwards by running
`vendor/bin/typo3 extension:setup`.
